Instructions for filling in data template:

sheet 1 - "LC_data"

Please fill in at least two identifiers and all fields for LC data.
(concentration_mM -  theoretical concentration of the compound in mM)


sheet 2 - "LC_program"

Please give information about the eluent program used in analysis. 
For used eluents please specify solvent, additives, additive concentration, pH, buffers etc.
e.g. 	A: H2O, 0.1 mM HCOOH, pH 3.7
	B: MeCN 


sheet 3 - "Instrument"

Please fill in all fields about the instrument and integration.

model 	- e.g. Agilent 6460 triple quadrupole, linear ion trap hybrid Orbitrap Elite, Thermo Orbitrap QExactive etc.
vendor 	- e.g. Bruker, Agilent, Thermo etc.
mass_analyser - e.g. Q, QQQ, QTOF, orbitrap, ion trap etc.
source 	- electrospray ionization source, e.g. ESI, HESI, nanoESI, Z-spray, JetStream etc.

program   - which program was used for integration, e.g. XCalibur, MassLynx, MSDial etc.
area_type - Which type of area is given in LC data (base peak or sum of all isotopes)
